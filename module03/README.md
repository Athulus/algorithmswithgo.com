# Module 03 - Basic Data Structures

This module is TBD. Right now I'm thinking it will be on basic data structures like linked lists, dynamic lists, queues, stacks, priority queues, and more, as these will be really useful when we get into some later algorithms.

## 01 - Why sorting algorithms?

## 02 - Bubble sort

## 03 - Bubble sort [code]



## 04 - Insertion sort

## 05 - Insertion sort without binary search [code]

## 06 - Binary search

## 07 - Binary search [code]

## 08 - Insertion sort with binary search [code]

## 09 - Recursion

We can go back over many problems from Module 01 for this.

- Sum all numbers in a list
- Convert a number from decimal to another base
- Fib
- GCD
- More?

## 10 - Divide and conquer

Often taught around recursion because the two mentally go hand in hand.

- Binary search

We will see more of these as we get into sorting algorithms, but I'll leave those for those sections and mention then that they are divide and conquery.

## 11 - Merge sort

## 12 - Merge sort [code]

## 13 - Merge sort with goroutines [code]

## 14 - Quicksort explained

## 15 - Quicksort [code]

## 16 - Big O

## 17 - Benchmarking some sorting algorithms

## 18 - Combining algorithms [code]
